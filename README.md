** Developing...... **

** Now stop for a while...... **

This tiny project is mainly developed in the environment of Ubuntu 14.04.
And the key point used in this project is the teconology of CSS3, HTML5 and some
JS. The animation in the pages are achieved by CSS3 and
the canvas is based on Flower Power, a charming project in HTML5. JS is used to control
the whole process. So, there is nothing difficult.

IE, Firefox and Chrome on windows all passed the test. As for other explorers, I guess there won't be
many problems. Because it's just a front-end project. Specially, for chrome on Ubuntu 14.04,
the font based on the system is not so suitable, so the UI maybe a little ugly, which indicates that the
codes are ugly too T_T. While Firefox performs perfect.

Getting invoveld with the web field for only 5 months and amazed by the presentation ability that it provides,
I just want to do more things. So please forgive the drawbacks of this tiny work. I am not a NB man. And I am
still on the way to the peak of the fascinating web world.

For using, open the "Click Me.html" in your browser, chrome/Firefox/IE 9+ on windows may be the best choice.
