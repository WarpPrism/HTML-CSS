**Introduction**

* This tiny project is mainly developed in the environment of Ubuntu 14.04.
And the key point used in this project is the teconology of CSS3, HTML5 and
some JS. The animation in the pages are achieved by CSS3 and the canvas is
based on Flower Power, a charming project in HTML5. JS is used to control
the whole process. So, there is nothing difficult.

* IE, Firefox and Chrome on windows all passed the test. As for other explorers,
I guess there won't be many problems. Because it's just a front-end project. 
Specially, for chrome on Ubuntu 14.04, the font based on the system is not so
suitable, so the UI maybe a little ugly, which indicates that the codes are ugly
too T_T. While Firefox performs perfect.

* Getting invoveld with the web field for only 5 months and amazed by the
presentation ability that it provides, I just want to do more things. So 
please forgive the drawbacks of this tiny work. I am not a NB man. And I
am still on the way to the peak of the fanscinating web world. I am on the 
shoulder of hackerzhou, who is a real big-god. And I made this project based
on his codes. Thanks for his excellent website:http://love.hackerzhou.me/.

* For using, open the **"Click_Me.html"** in your browser, chrome/Firefox/IE 9+
on windows may be the best choice.

**简介**

* 在windows环境下双击 **"Click_Me.html"**， 因为该项目在windows的浏览器环境下有较好的兼容性。
