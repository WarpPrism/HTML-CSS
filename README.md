**Introduction**

* This tiny project is mainly developed in the environment of Ubuntu 14.04.
And the key point used in this project is the teconology of CSS3, HTML5 and
some JS. The animation in the pages are achieved by CSS3 and the canvas is
based on Flower Power, a charming project in HTML5. JS is used to control
the whole process. So, there is nothing difficult.

* IE, Firefox and Chrome on windows all passed the test. As for other explorers,
I guess there won't be many problems. Because it's just a front-end project. 
Specially, for chrome on Ubuntu 14.04, the font based on the system is not so
suitable, so the UI maybe a little ugly, which indicates that the codes are ugly
too T_T. While Firefox performs perfect.

* But this project doesn't cross device and doesn't cross screen. It supports 
only 1365 * 768 screen or about. If you have a wide screen, sorry, it will not 
display normally


* Getting involved with the web field for only 5 months and amazed by the
presentation ability that it provides, I just want to do more things. So 
please forgive the drawbacks in this tiny work. I am not a NB man. And I
am still on the way to the peak of the fanscinating web world. And I stand
on the shoulder of hackerzhou, who is a real big-god. And I made this project
based on his codes. Thanks for his excellent website:http://love.hackerzhou.me/.

* For using, open the **"Click_Me.html"** in your browser, chrome/Firefox/IE 9+
may be the best choice. Also you need a PC with 1365 * 768 screen or about.
Generally, most laptop can run correctly.

只有你痴迷于文字的形状超越其语言用途的美学意义 
只有你能从音乐旋律中看见绚烂的色彩与流动的形状 
只有你会为夕阳下旋转鸟笼的斑驳光影驻足 
只有你……
